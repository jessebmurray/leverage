    "## Abstract\n",
    "\n",
    "Leveraged ETFs have been gaining attention as high-risk investment instruments that can potentially provide large multiples of the underlying indices they track. One prominent example is UPRO, which returns 3x the daily return of the S&P 500. That is, if the S&P 500 falls by 1% in a single trading day, UPRO will fall by 3% - and vice versa if the S&P 500 rises in price. \n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to reveal how leveraged ETFs might be deployed within a long-term equity portfolio by simulating ten-year returns from historical data. The data is S&P 500 daily prices and annual dividend yields going back to 1927. The strategy tested is to invest a certain percentage of the equity portfolio in the 3x leveraged version, with the remaining in the standard, non-leveraged version, assuming reinvestment of dividends and the tax-advantaged strategy of rebalancing the portfolio once a year (returning to the original leverage percentage). I analyze the performance of this strategy with leverage percentages from 0% to 100% across all 20,756 possible ten-year periods since 1927. \n",
